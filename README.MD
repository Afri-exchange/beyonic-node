The unofficial Node Js library for interacting http://beyonic.com APIs


### Installation
```
npm install beyonic-node
```

### Development

We built this module to enable merchants in Africa to active mobile payments out the box and thus immensely simplify payment collection for their customers. Beyonic doesn't offer an in-house node-js module and we couldn't find a dependable 3rd party module as well. So, we built ourselves and decided to share it with everyone! :slightly_smiling_face:


Eila (https://eila.io) is a SaaS platform that enables merchants to build and manage a chat-based shop that sits right within their social media page & automates customers sales & interaction.
